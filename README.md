# Metropolis-Hastings-Algorithm

This [project](https://github.com/nbizzle23/Metropolis-Hastings-Algorithm/blob/master/hnh.pdf) discusses Metropolis, Metropolis-Hastings and Gibbs Sampling Algorithms. Essentially they generate a sequence of random samples from
a probability distribution to approximate a density of interest when its difficult to sample directly.
